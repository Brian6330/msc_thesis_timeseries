# msc_thesis_timeseries

Repository for my Master Thesis' code base, that is under the [exascale](https://exascale.info/) institute at University of Fribourg, Switzerland.

The thesis on the general topic of Timeseries and focuses on:
- Python Implementation of the IIM (Individual Imputation Model)
- Implementing the shared information metric
- Parametrizing algorithms timeseries recovery algorithms, based on the category: matrix-based, pattern-based, neural-network-based, and regression-based.
- Using a GUI that shows the effects of the different parameters on the different types of algorithms and their output for reconstruction.
